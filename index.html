                    <p>
                        Most people heard about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. But many people don't realize that because of old houses, aging infrastructure, and lax regulatations, water issues are a problem in many communities around the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The CDC, pediatricians, health professionals, and even the EPA all say: <strong>There is NO safe amount of lead.</strong> Even a little bit of lead can build up over time and be harmful, particularly to growing kids and people with health concerns. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We aren't in the business of scaring you into buying a test. But unfortunately lead in drinking water is a real issue around the country. Reuters recently found <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/">lead poisoning in over 3,000 communities</a> across the United States with rates double - or worse - than were found in Flint, Michigan.

                                        Lead pipes were legal and commonly used in water distribution pipes and in homes before 1986. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While some houses have had their pipes replaced, many have not. Further, many cities haven't replaced their lead pipes due to costs.

                                        Unlike other water contaminants, lead in your water is invisible.

                                        And health experts all agree: lead is terrible for your brain and body. It hinders brain function, stunts growth in children, has long-term health implications, and can even be fatal.

                                        Most water testing is done by the local water utility at their treatment plants. But after that, water travels inside water mains under the street, into pipes under your house, through your sink, and out your faucet.

                            We give you the peace of mind that the water you and your family drink is lead-free. Instead of using cheap, unreliable testing strips like what you find on Amazon or at department stores, we send your sample to our professional, government-certified partner laboratories. They test your water using state-of-the-art methods capable of detecing lead down to 1 part per billion!

                                Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.

                                We've spent years working in and around government to make public services better. After the stories from Flint, Michigan hit the headlines, we started worrying about our water. We wanted to make sure our water was safe to drink. We wanted to make sure our family's water was safe to drink.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We found a number of testing kits online and in stores, but they weren't very trustworthy. Then we tried to contact our local water testing labs, but ordering a single test was complicated. Government labs were too slow, hard to navigate, and face-less. Commercial labs were too expensive and only provided the data - no recommendations for what to do next. Both told us they spend most of their time with industry and companies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>So we made a company.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We think this process should be easy for the people who need it the most. But right now it's not. So we...
                                <div class="container-help">
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>...found the top professional, government-certified labs so that you don't have to go looking.</li>
                                        <li>...figured out how to work with them so you don't have to.</li>
                                        <li>...reduced the cost to you by negotiating volume discounts. 
                                        <li>...take care of the business stuff these labs need.</li>
                                        <li>...reduced the ordering process to just a click of a button.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 Water is important! After years of under investment in public infrastructure, and with the changes of climate change now affecting us, we fear that the days of taking the safety of our drinking water for granted may be behind us. We advocate for policies to modernize our water system. In fact we hope those happen and they take us out of business.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 But in the mean time, you should consider your water and test it yourself, if only just to make sure. And we’ve built a service that makes that process simple, fast, and trustworthy.
