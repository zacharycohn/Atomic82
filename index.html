                    <p>
                        Most people heard about the lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan.
                    <p>
                        But many people don't realize that because of old houses, aging infrastructure, and lax regulatations, water issues are a problem in many communities around the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reuters found over <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/">lead poisoning in over 3,000 communities</a> across the United States with rates double - or worse - than were found in Flint, Michigan.

                                    <p>
                                        Lead pipes were extremely common in houses built before 1986? Unfortunately, most houses in the United States were built before 1986.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While some houses have had their plumbing replaced, many have not. The government does not monitor what pipes inside houses are made from. 
                                    <p>
                                        Anyone living in an older house should check what their pipes are made from or have their water tested immediately.

                                    <p>
                                        Unlike other water contaminants, lead in your water is invisible. And health experts all agree: lead is terrible for your brain and body. 
                                    <p>
                                        It hinders brain function, stunts growth in children, has long-term health implications, and can even be fatal.

                                    <p>
                                        There is an EPA-set acceptable threshhold of lead in water, but there is no "safe" amount of lead. It's especially dangerous for infants, children, and the infirm.

                                        Most water testing is done by the local water utility at their treatment plants. 
                                    <p>
                                        But after that, water travels inside water mains buried under the streets, into the water pipes under your house, through your sink's pipes, and out your faucet. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Lead could get in your water from any of these places before you drink it. 
                                    </p>

                        We aren't in the business of scaring you into buying a test. But lead in drinking water is, unfortunately, a real issue around the country. We want to give you the peace of mind that the water you and your family are consuming is safe and lead-free.

                                Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.

They test your samples for lead using advanced, state of the art testing equipment. They can find trace amounts of lead down to 1 part per billion (The EPA threshhold for taking drastic action is 15 parts per billion).

                            We are two guys who have spent years working in and around government to make public services better. After the stories from Flint, Michigan hit the headlines, we started worrying about our water. We wanted to make sure our water was safe to drink. We wanted to make sure our family's water was safe to drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We found a number of testing kits online and in stores, but those weren't very trustworthy. Then we tried to contact our local water testing labs, but ordering a single test was complicated. Government labs were too slow, hard to navigate, and face-less. Commercial labs were too expensive and only provided the data - no recommendations for what to do next. Both told us they spend most of their time with industry and companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we made a company.

                        <p>
                            We've found the top professional, government-certified labs so you don't have to do the searching. We've figured out how to work with them so you don't have to. We can take advantage of volume pricing to get you cheaper tests. We can take care of all the complicated business stuff these labs want, so all you have to do is click a button to order a test.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We simplify things for you, because your world is complicated enough. We'll help you understand what's coming out of your tap and how it might effect your family's health.
