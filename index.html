                                        Most heard about what happened in Flint, Michigan. But many people don’t realize that lead water pipes are a nation-wide issue. Reuters found over 3,000 communities across the United States with lead poisoning rates double - or worse - than Flint. It's a public health crisis that more and more communities are realizing affects them.

                                        Health experts all agree: Lead is terrible for your brain and body. It hinders brain function, stunts growth in children, has long-term health implications, and can even be fatal. Though the EPA has set an acceptable threshhold of lead in water, there is no "ok" amount of lead. It's especially dangerous for infants, children, and the infirm.

                                        Most water testing is done by the local water utility at their treatment plants. But after that, water travels inside water mains buried under the streets, into the water pipes under your house, through your sink's pipes, and out your faucet. Lead could get in your water from any of these places before you drink it.

                                Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.

                                You can go to Home Depot or Amazon and buy DIY testing strips, but these are hard to read, unregulated, and untrustworthy. They’re just not very good. To really have confidence in the test, you'd want to send a sample off to a certified lab. But which lab to do you call? How do you find them? Which ones work with individual consumers?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With online ordering, to-your-door delivery, and partnerships with professional, government certified water testing labs, we bring the power of lab-quality testing services to the people who need them the most. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We aren't in the business of scaring you into buying a test. But lead in drinking water is, unfortunately, a real issue around the country. We want to give you the peace of mind that the water you and your family are consuming is safe and lead-free.

                                        We don't use those cheap, unreliable testing strips you can find on Amazon. We send your water sample to our professional, government certified testing labs. They test your samples for lead using advanced, state of the art testing equipment. They can find trace amounts of lead down to 1 part per billion (The EPA threshhold for taking drastic action is 15 parts per billion).

                            We are two guys who have spent years working in and around government to make public services better. After the stories from Flint, Michigan hit the headlines, we started worrying about our water. We wanted to make sure our water was safe to drink. We wanted to make sure our family's water was safe to drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We found a number of testing kits online and in stores, but those weren't very trustworthy. Then we tried to contact our local water testing labs, but ordering a single test was complicated. Government labs were too slow, hard to navigate, and face-less. Commercial labs were too expensive and only provided the data - no recommendations for what to do next. Both told us they spend most of their time with industry and companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we made a company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We've found the top professional, government-certified labs so you don't have to do the searching. We've figured out how to work with them so you don't have to. We can take advantage of volume pricing to get you cheaper tests. We can take care of all the complicated business stuff these labs want, so all you have to do is click a button to order a test.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We simplify things for you, because your world is complicated enough. We'll help you understand what's coming out of your tap and how it might effect your family's health.
