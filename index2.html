                                Your local water utility does tests at the water treatment plants. But where does your water go after that?
                            <ul>
                                <li>through water mains buried under the streets</li>
                                <li>into the water pipes under your house</li>
                                <li>through your kitchen pipes</li>
                                <li>Finally, out of your faucet or refrigerator.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Your local government does only has to test a small number of homes in your city, and they don't necessarily do it every year.

                                        Many people know about the lead contamination crisis happening in Flint, Michigan. But many people don’t realize that aging infrastructure and lax regulatory systems are a nation-wide crisis.

                                        Lead pipes used to be very common in cities and houses before we knew how dangerous they are. They were banned in 1986, but that law didn't require replacing the lead pipes already out there.

                                        Unfortunately, many cities didn't keep great records. Many aren't sure if they have lead pipes, or if they do, where they even are.

                                Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.

                                You can buy a at-home testing strips on Amazon for about $20 dollars. However, our experience and online reviews demonstrates these testing strips hard to read.

                                We don't use the unreliable testing strips you can find on Amazon or at your department store. We send your water sample to our professional, government-certified drinking water testing laboratory partners. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our labs test your water for lead using advanced, state of the art testing equipment called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry">inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry</a> to determine what is in your water - and how much.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The EPA regulatory threshold for taking drastic action is 15 parts per billion. 
                            <p>
                                However, this is a bit decieving: <strong>The CDC, pediatricians and health professionals, and even the EPA all say there is NO safe amount of lead</strong>. 
                            <p>
                                Even a little bit of lead can build up over time and be harmful, particularly to growing kids and people with health concerns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The chemists we work with can find trace amounts of lead down to 1 part per billion. Since there is no such thing as a safe level of lead, we think this level of specificity matters.

                    <div class="row-team">
                        <p>
                            We've spent years working in and around government to make public services better. After the stories from Flint, Michigan hit the headlines, we started worrying about our water. We wanted to make sure our water was safe to drink. We wanted to make sure our family's water was safe to drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We found a number of testing kits online and in stores, but we didn't trust them. Then we tried to contact some water testing labs, but ordering a single test was complicated. Commercial labs were too expensive and only provided the data - no recommendations for what to do next. Government labs were too slow, hard to navigate, and face-less. Both told us they spend most of their time with industry and companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>So we started a company.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We've made this process simple for you. We...
                        <ul>
                            <li>found the top professional, government-certified labs so you don't have to do the searching.</li>
                            <li>figured out how to work with them so you don't have to. </li>
                            <li>take advantage of volume pricing to get you cheaper tests. </li>
                            <li>take care of all the complicated business stuff these labs want, so all you have to do is click a button to order a test.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Water is important! After years of under investment in public infrastructure, and with the changes of climate change now affecting us, we fear that the days of taking the safety of our drinking water for granted may be behind us. We hope and advocate for policies to modernize our water system. In fact we hope those happen and they take us out of business.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But in the mean time, we think you may want to consider your water and test it yourself, if only just to make sure. And we’ve built a product and service that makes that process simple, fast, and trustworthy.
